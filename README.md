# Web Developer Portfolio
This project showcases an 3D web developer portfolio that I've developed using ReactJS. 
One of the key highlights of this portfolio is the integration of ThreeJs, a powerful JavaScript library, which enables seamless rendering and fluid animations of 3D models. This adds a visual touch to the portfolio, making it stand out from traditional web developer portfolios.
In addition to the 3D features, I've also focused on enhancing interactivity on the webpage. To achieve this, I've utilized various technologies. Firstly, TailwindCSS has been implemented to provide a flexible and responsive layout, ensuring that the portfolio looks great across different devices and screen sizes.
Furthermore, Framer Motion, a popular animation library, has been incorporated to bring smooth and captivating transitions to different sections of the webpage. These animations not only improve the visual appeal but also contribute to a seamless user experience.
Lastly, I've integrated emailJS to enable users to easily contact me directly from the portfolio website. This simplifies the process of communication and encourages potential clients or collaborators to get in touch effortlessly.
